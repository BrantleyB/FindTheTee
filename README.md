# Find The Tee

## Here is a link to [Find the Tee](https://find-the-tee.herokuapp.com/)

## Main Project:

### This project was made using Ruby on Rails, Postgres and React. The basic functionality is the ability to add new courses and also view courses that were added, including Course name, location, a picture of that course, a small description and the difficulty of the course ranging from 1-10.

## Struggles:

### The main struggles were the use of toggleState's. I used the same form for create and edit and in turn that caused issues that I have yet to fix but will fix in the future.

## Future Features:

### There are many features I'm looking forward to adding to this project. A few of the major ones are a search function for the courses by either course name or location. Another feature would be adding more pages to look at, and be able to access then through a nav bar. The final feature would be adding google maps to the app to pinpoint the courses locations.
